### Greetings.

I'm a software developer working at [@innotechengineering](https://github.com/innotechengineering).

I graduated _summa cum laude_ in 2022 from [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu/) with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering and a bachelor's degree in physics.

My interests are:

* Firmware in C
* Embedded and IoT devices
* Web development with React frontends, and FastAPI or Flask backends
* Linux systems
* Typesetting with LaTeX
* Traveling: ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¸ (soon: :chile:)

Things I want to learn more of:

* Android development: Kotlin and Jetpack Compose
* Rust, specifically for embedded devices

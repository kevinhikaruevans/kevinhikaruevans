I'm a software developer working at [@innotechengineering](https://github.com/innotechengineering). I graduated summa cum laude in 2022 from [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu/) with a bachelors in computer engineering and a bachelors in physics.

My interests are:

* Firmware in C, especially on:
   * ESP32 with ESP-IDF
   * Xilinx Zynq chips (with Verilog)
* Embedded and IoT devices
* Web development with React frontends, and FastAPI or Flask backends
* Linux systems
* Typesetting with LaTeX
* Traveling: ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¸ (soon: :chile:)
